It addressed three challenges: multi-day assignment (SES-MAP), optimization including travel considerations (SEHCS-MAPTP), and multi-center management at the departmental level. For SES-MAP, a multi-objective MILP model maximized student satisfaction and balanced workload. For SEHCS-MAPTP, MILP models and metaheuristics optimized assignment and planning, incorporating travel and distance. Multi-center management combined hierarchical mission allocation and internal center planning. This work produced four papers, including two in scientific journals, and was presented at one national and two international conferences."},{"name":"A Novel Software Tool for Antenna Design - Antenna Optimizer System (AOS)","startDate":"2019-03-01","endDate":"2020-02-29","summary":"In this project, I developed an Antenna Optimizer System (AOS), a software tool that optimizes antenna dimensions to meet frequency and bandwidth specifications. AOS operates in three phases: initialization (preparation), optimization (IWO algorithm and cost functions), and finalization (results validation). Tested on a multi-band dipole antenna, AOS demonstrated speed and efficiency compared to CST's optimizer (genetic algorithm), with two papers published in an international conference."},{"name":"Platform to Promote and Optimize Access to Shared Taxis in Lebanon","startDate":"2018-05-01","endDate":"2018-10-31","summary":"This project involved a platform to improve the relationship between passengers and public transport, especially Lebanese public taxis known as 'service'.
