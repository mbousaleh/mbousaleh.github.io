Hello ! üòÅ

I am a research scientist and engineer dedicated to optimizing and enhancing individuals‚Äô daily lives through innovative technological solutions. With a PhD in Informatics specializing in Operations Research and Optimization and a Master‚Äôs in Engineering in Computer and Communications, I bring a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to problem-solving and project execution.
I thrive on the challenge of developing and implementing innovative solutions that address broadly relevant problems. 
My goal is to contribute to developing cutting-edge solutions that address real-world challenges and drive technological progress.

I hold a Ph.D. in Informatics in 2023 from the NIT-O2S Laboratory at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comt√© (UBFC) and the University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard (UTBM), France. In my doctoral thesis, I tackled complex resource assignment and planning problems specifically in the domains of specialised education and home care services. My expertise encompasses a range of advanced methodologies, including Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, as well as heuristic, and meta-heuristic approaches, with a particular emphasis on resolving assignment, scheduling, and routing problems. I has successfully developed innovative multi-objective optimisation approaches and tools, resulting in several publications in high-impact journals and presentations at prestigious international conferences. My work has made significant contributions to the fields of Operations Research and Optimization, providing practical and impactful solutions to challenges in logistics and healthcare. My research not only enhances theoretical understanding but also translates into valuable real-world applications.
